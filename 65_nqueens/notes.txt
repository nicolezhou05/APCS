HW65: How Many Queens Can a Thinker Place, If a Thinker Can Place Queens...
2022-02-16
Time Spent: 1.5 hrs

DISCO:
We thought about a backtracking algorithm, so that we remove queens that cause problems.

QCC:
How can we make this produce not just one solution for a specific sized chess board?
As in, can we get all the solutions for a specific sized grid, and how?

How many solutions are there for a specific size grid?
Is there a formula?

Also, we're not sure if we need to return a false statement in the solve() method, if we should always get a true by backtracking.
*After further thought, it will have to return false for small boards (4 or lower?).
