---------------------------DEBUGGING---------------------------

Compile-time errors: there is something wrong with the syntax of the program
- Only the first error is truly reliable. Fix one error at a time and then recompile the program
- Use the information the compiler gives you as a guideline, otherwise broaden the search
- Balanced parentheses/brackets, uppercase != lowercase, semicolons at the end, right type
- Make sure the program you are editing is the program the compiler is compiling.
- Debug by bisection: make backup, delete half of code, compile, repeat
- Compilers can be wrong

Run-time errors: produced if something goes wrong while the program is running
- Can figure out things out by adding print statements
- Hanging: (program stops and seems to be doing nothing) caught in an infinite loop/recursion
- Infinite loop- add print statement displaying the values of the variables in the condition and the value of the condition (should be false at the end)
- Infinite recursion- check base case, add print statement at the beginning of the method that displays the parameters
- Flow of execution- print "entering method methodName", display the arguments each method receives, most common: providing arguments in the wrong order
- Exception- examine the place in the program where the error occurred
- Getting buried in output- either simplify the output or simplify the program
- Find the minimal test case and reorganize the program

Logic errors: cause the program to do the wrong thing
- Find the section of the code that performs the function
- Make sure you understand the code
- Break the program into components and test them separately
- Integer division goes to zero, use double if you want fractions
- Floating point numbers are only approximate and you should never use == on double
- When using ==, check if they are identical. Use equals when checking equivalence
- Break complex expressions to parts that are easier to read

Walk away for a while if you're really struggling to find the bug or bring have someone else look at it
