DISCO
0) javac -classpath .:../sinbad.jar -d . Driver.java does not work for all operating systems.
1) printUsageString() shows the available data labels
2) When using fetch(), first parameter should be the name of the constructor. The rest of the parameters should correspond to the parameters of the constructor we are using.
3) If the first parameter inside fetch() does not match the name of the constructor we are using, we will get an error.

QCC
0) We see fetch(), (fetchList(), fetchArray(), fetchString(), etc. How are these different from each other and when do we know when to use which?

<Non-Disclosure Agreement>'s CSV FLOW:
<insert your description of your tools and workflow in creating, editing CSV files>
0) duckies and members from the trio
1) computers and the tutorial that explains some parts of sinbad.jar

TRUBZ
<this lab involves using tools that are likely to introduce hiccups; log any troubleshooting issues here>
0) "javac -classpath .:../sinbad.jar -d . Driver.java" --- it took a long time to figure out what was wrong with this
1) fetch() was something new
2) Using data labels from printUsageString()
