HW90 -- Swabbing the Deque
2022-04-12
time spent: 0.6 hrs


DISCO:
0) We had to import LinkedList because deque is a node class.
1) Some methods are for capacity-restricted deques (but we did not implement them)
2) (ERROR: non-static type variable Card cannot be referenced from a static context) -> Specify type in main method
3) If we have a method in the interface that is not used in the implementing class, then we would get an error.

QCC:
0) In what case should we use removeFirst() or pollFirst()?
