DISCO:
0) The code for each of the orders are pretty similar, just the placement of the SOP differs.

QCC:
0) What happens when you don't call a method private, public, etc. (just the return type and name of method)

L = level, d = depth, h = height...
1) a perfect binary tree has (2^h - 1) nodes
2) at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^L nodes
3) height of a complete binary tree with n nodes is log_2 (n)
