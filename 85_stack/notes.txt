DISCO
0) Since both LinkedLists and ArrayLists have size() functions, and both
can be expanded when adding something, it is no longer necessary to have
a separate instance variable for the number of stack items.
1) Correspondingly, capacity needs to be an instance variable

QCC
0) We expanded capacity by multiplying the original capacity by 2.
1) When we write a method (that does not exist in the interface) into a java file
that implements that same interface, we cannot call that method in a tester file.
